Drop beans at 5sec remaining.\n\nI tried regular Diedrich Style roast profile and cut it short before the final 1-minute heat section.  The bean was about 5.5 oz of Sweet Maria's Ethiopiques Blend 2.0.  It turned out a good cup.\n\nFor the next batch, this drops the last, hottest step in the Diedrich Style roast profile and adds an intermediate one-minute step, prolonging the initial warming up.\n\nI have yet to record first crack point below.\n\nTimes quoted are profile times.\n\n1st Crack starts at about 13:30 (early into step 15) and goes on vigorously for about 1:30.",
